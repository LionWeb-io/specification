= LionWeb Serialization Format Version 2023.1
:toc: preamble
:toclevels: 3

This document describes the serialization format for LionWeb chunks.

== Design goals
We want to provide boring and proven infrastructure, so that innovation can be built on top of it.
We do not take any measures to reduce the amount of transmitted data.{fn-org73}
We strive for shallow structures to enable stream-based processing.

== Description
LionWeb node serialization format is defined in JSON (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259[RFC 8259]).

We follow the advice of RFC 8259 to be "interoperable", i.e. we assume object keys are unique, and their order is undefined.
Any violations SHOULD be reported as error.{fn-org159}

== Overview of structures

No unspecified _members_ are allowed anywhere in the structure.{fn-org67}

plantuml::serialization.puml[format=svg]

=== Root structure

[[SerializationChunk]]
Root level MUST be an _object_ with three _members_, called *serialization chunk*.

[[SerializationChunk.serializationFormatVersion, `serializationFormatVersion`]]
The first _member_ SHOULD be _key_ `serializationFormatVersion` with a _string_ _value_.{fn-org58}{fn-org159}{fn-org172}
The value MUST be a non-empty string (without leading or trailing whitespace){fn-org165} describing the serialization format version used to create the processed document, according to <<versions>>.

[[SerializationChunk.languages]]
The second _member_ SHOULD be _key_ `languages` with an _array_ _value_.{fn-org76}{fn-org78}{fn-org159}
Each _element_ in the value array MUST adhere to <<language>>.
The order of _elements_ is undefined.
_elements_ MUST contain all language/version referred to by any <<meta-pointer>> in the processed document.
Each _element_ MUST be unique with respect to all its _members_.

[[SerializationChunk.nodes]]
The third _member_ SHOULD be _key_ `nodes` with an _array_ _value_.{fn-org33}{fn-org159}
Each _element_ in the value array MUST adhere to <<node>>.
The order of _elements_ is undefined.
Each _element_ MUST be unique with respect to the value of its _key_ `id`.

[[language]]
=== Language structure
[[UsedLanguage]]
Each *used language* MUST be an _object_.{fn-org129}
The order of _members_ is undefined.

NOTE: If the chunk describes a language (M2), it might include instances of builtins' language entities.
In this case, builtins MUST be listed as *used language* like any other language.{fn-org153}

The _object_ MUST contain the following _members_:{fn-org76}

* [[UsedLanguage.key]] _key_ `key` with _string_ _value_, adhering to <<language-key>>.
* [[UsedLanguage.version]] _key_ `version` with _string_ _value_, adhering to <<language-version>>.

[[language-key]]
==== Language key
A _string_ according to <<{m3}.adoc#keys, Key spec>>.
Refers to the <<{m3}.adoc#IKeyed.key, key>> of the language.

[[language-version]]
==== Language version
A _string_ with any contents{fn-org128}{fn-org130}, MUST NOT be empty.{fn-org92}
Refers to the <<{m3}.adoc#Language.version, version>> of the language.

[[meta-pointer]]
=== Meta-pointer
[[MetaPointer]]
A *meta-pointer* is a reference from M1 to M2.{fn-org89}{fn-mof}
It's used at several places within <<node>>.

Each meta-pointer MUST be an _object_.
The order of _members_ is undefined.

The _object_ MUST contain the following _members_:

* [[MetaPointer.lanuage]] _key_ `language` with _string_ _value_, adhering to <<language-key>>.
* [[MetaPointer.version]] _key_ `version` with _string_ _value_, adhering to <<language-version>>.
* [[MetaPointer.key]] _key_ `key` with _string_ _value_ according to <<{m3}.adoc#keys, Keys spec>>.
Refers to some <<{m3}.adoc#IKeyed, element in the language>>.
Which element exactly is specified for each usage of meta-pointer.

[[node]]
=== Node structure
[[Node]]
Each *node* MUST be an _object_.{fn-org37}
The order of _members_ is undefined.

The _object_ MUST contain the following _members_:{fn-org59}{fn-java33}{fn-org55}

* [[Node.id]] _key_ `id` with _string_ _value_, adhering to <<id>>.
* [[Node.classifier]] _key_ `classifier`{fn-org37-name}{fn-org184} with _object_ _value_, adhering to <<meta-pointer>>.
  The *meta-pointer*'s ``key``'s _value_ refers to the <<{m3}.adoc#IKeyed.key, *key*>> of the <<{m3}.adoc#Concept, *Concept*>> or <<{m3}.adoc#Annotation, *Annotation*>> this *node* is an instance of.
* [[Node.properties]] _key_ `properties` with _array_ _value_, each _element_ adhering to <<property>>.
The order of _elements_ is undefined.{fn-org156}
* [[Node.containments]] _key_ `containments`{fn-org55-name-children}{fn-org206} with _array_ _value_, each _element_ adhering to <<containment>>.
The order of _elements_ is undefined.{fn-org156}
* [[Node.references]] _key_ `references`{fn-org55-name-references} with _array_ _value_, each _element_ adhering to <<reference>>.
The order of _elements_ is undefined.{fn-org156}
* [[Node.annotations]] _key_ `annotations`{fn-org150} with _array_ _value_, each _element_ adhering to <<annotation>>.
The order of _elements_ MUST be maintained.{fn-org157}
* [[Node.parent]] _key_ `parent`{fn-org187} with _string_ or _null_ _value_, adhering to <<parent>>.

For all features (i.e. `properties`, `containments`, and `references`) defined for a **node**'s classifier:{fn-org33}

* During serialization, we SHOULD include every feature, even if unset.
In the latter case:
** the *property* MUST have `value` = _null_;
** the *containment* MUST have `children` = _empty array_;
** the *reference* MUST have `targets` = _empty array_;
* During deserialization, we MUST accept a *node* even if not all defined features are present.
* We MAY accept undefined features during deserialization if we can deal with them in a meaningful manner.

NOTE: We currently cannot store "invalid text" (i.e. user-entered text that does not adhere to the underlying structure and/or constraints) in the model.
We will support this in a future release.{fn-org62}

[[property-values]]
=== Property serialization
All property values MUST be serialized as JSON _string_.{fn-org34}{fn-org9}.

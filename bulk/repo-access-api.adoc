[[bulk]]
= Bulk Repository Access API
:toc: preamble
:toclevels: 2

The bulk API *version 2025.1* is used to store and retrieve nodes in batches at the moment of invocation.{fn-org25}
It is intended for CRUD operations on (larger) sets of nodes.
it is *not* intended as a delta-oriented API that takes "modification commands" as arguments.

== Conventions used in this document
* ALL-CAPS key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/bcp14[BCP14] (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119[RFC2119], https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8174[RFC8174]) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
* Footnotes refer to more discussions and rationale, but are non-normative.

[[use-cases]]
== Use Cases
We describe the use cases from a client's perspective.

* "I'm starting up, which partitions do you know about?", i.e. <<listPartitions, list possible contents>>.
* "Let's have a new slate, add a new partition", i.e. <<createPartitions, partition creation>>.
* "This part is not needed any more, remove the partition", i.e. <<deletePartitions, partition deletion>>.
* "Give me the whole subtree under this node", i.e. actual <<retrieve, bulk data retrieval>>
* "Here is a node forest, store it as I hand it to you", i.e. actual <<store, bulk data storage>>.
** Sub-case with same behavior: "I'm a very simple client who only knows load and save (like a file), so whatever I send you is the truth", i.e. <<store, click-save-button>>.
* "I'm starting up, get me the current partition contents", i.e. <<retrieve, initial load>>.
* "I want to create a guaranteed new node, which id to use?", i.e. retrieval of <<ids, unused ids>>.

[[validity]]
== Validity assumptions
We don't need to know anything about languages for this API.{fn-org203}

We never sent partial nodes or features.{fn-org211}
Thus, we can only update or receive a complete node with all its features.
We cannot update only some of the features, or part of a feature (e.g. start of a string property value).

We assume transactional semantics for each modifying command.{fn-org229}
A command either succeeds completely, or fails completely and does not change the repository's content.

We do support invalid models w.r.t.{fn-org226}

* Violations of metamodel constraints, e.g. whether a Concept instance without parent is a partition, a feature instance can be part of its node instance, or a node mentioned as annotation is an Annotation instance.
* Unresolvable references, i.e. a <<{serialization}.adoc#reference, reference target node id>> unknown to the repository.

We enforce conformance to{fn-org223}

* Tree structure (i.e. at most one parent for each node)
* Symmetry between containment/annotation and parent
* No unresolvable containment/annotation ids
* No unresolvable parent ids
* A child node id MUST appear exactly once in all of its parent's containments
* An annotation node id MUST appear exactly once in all of its parent's annotations
* Every node MUST (directly or indirectly) be contained in a partition, except partitions themselves
* Partitions MUST NOT have a parent

[[out-of-scope]]
== Out of scope
We assume mapping API is separate from bulk API{fn-org94}.

For now, we do not support paging, as paging tree nodes is non-trivial.{fn-org204}

For now, we don't include any specific protections agains denial-of-service attacks.{fn-org237}

We don't describe the binding to any specific protocol (e.g. HTTP) as part of this specification; We only describe the semantics.{fn-org148}

[[deleted-nodes]]
== Deleted nodes
We don't have an explicit delete command for non-root nodes.{fn-org221}
We delete non-root nodes indirectly by sending their parent without the deleted node mentioned as child.
We can <<deletePartitions>> via explicit command.

We don't support [[orphan, orphans]]_orphans_ for now.
They are immediately deleted.{fn-org219}

Deleted nodes don't exist anymore in the repository from the client's point of view.
They might still exist in other contexts (e.g. another branch), or physically within the repository for internal reasons (e.g. storage optimization, concurrent editing support).
A deleted node MUST NOT appear in any responses according to this API.{fn-org220}

A repository MAY consider the deleted node's id to be _unused_, and thus allow to re-use it.
A repository also MAY disallow re-using previously deleted node ids.

[[client-ids]]
== Client ids
Each <<{arch}.adoc#client, client>> MUST  provide a unique _client id_ when connecting to the repository.{fn-org241}
The client id is an <<{m3}.adoc#identifiers, identifier>>-compatible string.
A client MAY connect more than once to the same repository at the same time with the same client id.
It is out of scope of LionWeb to guarantee the uniqueness of the client id.
The repository does not apply any uniqueness checks.

[[unknown-node-ids]]
== Unknown node ids
An _unknown node id_ is a node id that's not the node id of any node present in the repository.
An unknown node id can be present as a reference target (as we support unresolvable references).

How to handle unknown node ids in <<createPartitions>> and <<store>> commands?{fn-org94}{fn-org70}

Retrieves subtrees nested in the listed node ids.{fn-org201}

Calling this command MUST NOT change repository contents.

NOTE: We might add advanced filtering capabilities in the future, or introduce an additional querying API.

.Request parameters
[horizontal]
[[retrieve.nodeIds, `nodeIds`]]nodeIds:: <<nodeIdType>>[] List of node ids we want to retrieve from the repository.
Can be partition node ids and/or nested node ids.
[[retrieve.depthLimit, `depthLimit`]]depthLimit:: <<integerType>>? Limit the depth of retrieved subtrees.
Optional parameter, defaults to _infinite_.
If present, MUST be an integer >= 0, with

[[store, store]]
=== store: Put nodes into repository
Creates new nodes, or updates existing nodes in the repository.

We always process one node in its entirety, i.e. we cannot update parts of the node with this command.{fn-org211}

A node id referenced as parent, containment, reference, or annotation _can_ be mentioned in the same request, but _can_ be omitted if a node with that id already exists in the repository.
This way, we can move subtrees and add arbitrary references without sending unchanged nodes.

We consider that node to be _new_ if it has an <<unknown-node-ids, unknown node id>>.
Otherwise, we consider the node to be _updated_ (i.e. if a node with the same id already exists in the repository).

We do not support different modes.{fn-org230}

[[store.semantics]]
.Semantics
After completing this call, all sent nodes MUST have exactly the sent contents in the repository.
We must send containments/annotations from the parent's view, because we need to know the containment and index of the contained node/annotation within its parent.

If we move a contained/annotation node `C` from its previous parent `A` to its new parent `B`, we MUST send `B`, and MAY omit `A`.{fn-org227}
This means we can have implicit changes in `A`.

The whole call fails, without any changes to the repository, if it would lead to a <<validity, malformed model>>.{fn-org223}
The repository MUST NOT validate the metamodel constraints of the sent nodes.{fn-org226}

The repository MUST support changing <<{serialization}.adoc#meta-pointer, meta-pointers>>, e.g.  a node's `classifier.language`, a property's `property.version` or an enumeration literal's `key`.{fn-org69}

.Request parameters
[horizontal]
[[store.nodes, `nodes`]]nodes:: <<chunkType>> containing all nodes to store to the repository.
[[store.commandId, `commandId`]]commandId:: <<commandIdType>>

[[ids, ids]]
=== ids: Get available ids
Provides unused <<{m3}.adoc#identifiers, valid node ids>>.

The repository

* MUST NOT hand out the same unused ids to any other client.
* MAY hand out the same unused ids to the same client more than once.
* MUST NOT contain any node with any of the provided ids.

The ids MUST exclude the <<{m3}.adoc#predefined-builtins-keys, built-in ids>>.

Calling this command MUST NOT change repository contents themselves (besides the internal knowledge of reserved ids).

We don't assume leases, i.e. ids handed out to one client are "owned" by that client forever.
Rationale: Otherwise, the repository must track sessions, and run housekeeping on leases.
This would exclude simple repository implementations.

We assume infinite id space.

.Request parameters
[horizontal]
[[ids.count]]count:: <<integerType>> Number of ids requested.
The repository MUST return between one (inclusive) and `count` (inclusive) ids.
It MAY return less than `count` ids.
[[ids.commandId, `commandId`]]commandId:: <<commandIdType>>? Optional as this is not a modifying command.
[[ids.requestMessages]]messages:: <<messagesType>>[]?

.Response parameters
[horizontal]
[[ids.ids]]ids:: <<nodeIdType>>[] List of ids guaranteed to be free.
[[ids.success]]success:: <<successType>>
[[ids.responseMessages]]messages:: <<messagesType>>[]? with no special message kinds.


[[crud-mapping]]
== Mapping CRUD operations

list:: <<listPartitions>> for partitions, <<retrieve>> for descendants.

read:: <<retrieve, retrieve call>> with requested node ids (both partitions and other nodes).

create:: <<createPartitions>> for partitions, <<store, store call>> that sends a node with a <<ids, _new id_>>, including all its features.

update:: <<store, store call>> that sends a node (both partitions and other nodes) with an _existing id_, including all its features (both updated and unchanged).

delete:: <<deletePartitions>> for partitions (including all descendants), for others <<store>> of the parent node without mentioning the deleted node.

move:: Assume we want to move node `N` from its current parent `S` to its new parent `T`.
+
<<store, store call>> that sends `T` with all its features, including `N` in the children.
+
NOTE: We cannot move partitions, as we cannot nest them.{fn-org29}

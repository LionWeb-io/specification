[horizontal]
[[protocolMessagesType]]protocolMessages:: Optional <<protocolMessage>>s.

[[targetNodeType]]TargetNode:: Target's node as <<{m3}.adoc#node-id, id>>.

[[metaPointerType]]MetaPointer:: MetaPointer-tuple to describe an M2 element (classifier, feature, etc.).
Encoded as <<{serialization}.adoc#meta-pointer, meta-pointer>>.

[[propertyValueType]]PropertyValue:: Property value encoded as <<{serialization}.adoc#property-values, property value>>.

[[resolveInfoType]]ResolveInfo:: ResolveInfo of a reference as string.
Can be `null`.

[[indexType]]Index:: Position inside a multiple link or annotations as integer >= 0.
Cannot be `null`.
Use value `0` for <<{m3}.adoc#multiplicity, single links>>.

[[commandType]]Command:: Any <<commands, command>>.

[[commandIdType]]CommandId:: Id of a command.{fn-org305}
Same format as <<{m3}.adoc#identifiers, identifiers>>; must be unique per <<participation>>.

[[queryIdType]]QueryId:: Id of a query.
Same format as <<{m3}.adoc#identifiers, identifiers>>; must be unique per <<participation>>.

[[chunkType]]SerializationChunk:: Chunk of nodes as described in <<{serialization}.adoc, serialization specification>>.

[[eventType]]Event:: Any <<events, event>>.

[[participationIdType]]ParticipationId:: Id of a <<participation>>.
Same format as <<{m3}.adoc#identifiers, identifiers>>; must be unique for all concurrent participations.

[[clientIdType]]clientId:: Id of a <<client>>.
Same format as <<{m3}.adoc#identifiers, identifiers>>; must be stable over time for the same client to use <<qry-GetAvailableIds, reserved free node ids>>.

[[commandSourceType]]CommandSource:: _(<<participationIdType>>, <<commandIdType>>)_ tuple{fn-org306} this event is based on.
This allows a client to know when its command has been processed (either successful or not).

[[eventSequenceType]]EventSequenceNumber:: <<event-sequence-number>> of this event.

[[freeIdType]]FreeId:: Free <<{m3}.adoc#node-id, node id>>.

[[deltaProtocolVersionType]]DeltaProtocolVersion:: Version of the delta protocol, e.g. `2025.1`.

[[booleanType]]boolean:: A boolean value, i.e. either `true` or `false`.

[[integerType]]integer type:: An integer value.

==== How to address references
We refer to references by the tuple of _(parent, reference, index)_.
Rationale: Both reference `target` and `resolveInfo` can be `null`, so they aren't suitable for identifying the reference.
However, `target` and `resolveInfo` MUST NOT both be `null`.

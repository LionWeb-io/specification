[[evnt-Composite]]
[[evnt-CompositeEvent]]
===== Composite
The events in <<CompositeEvent.parts>> have happened in the given order.{fn-org281}

Composite events don't mention origin commands on their own; they are only mentioned in each part.{fn-org306}
We can nest composite events arbitrarily.{fn-org360}

.Technical name
`CompositeEvent` footnote:[
This event is the only one to have a `Event` suffix, which is necessary to distinguish it from its <<cmd-CompositeCommand, `CompositeCommand`>> counterpart.
All other events can be distinguished from their command counterparts by looking at whether the technical name reads as an imperative (“add child” — for commands), or in past perfect tense (”child [has been\] added” — for events).
(The <<evnt-NoOp, `NoOp`>> and <<evnt-ErrorEvent, `Error`>> don't have command counterparts.)

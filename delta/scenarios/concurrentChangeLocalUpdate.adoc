1. User enters new property value.
2. Client updates `nodeA` with new property value.
3. Client editor forwards user action into command.
4. Client sends <<cmd-AddProperty>> command with `nodeA` node id, `age` property (details omitted), `23` value and command id `cmd-1`.
5. Repository registers command for processing.
6. Repository acknowledges reception of command with id `cmd-1`.
7. Client registers processed command id `cmd-1`.
8. Another client sends <<cmd-AddProperty>> command `nodeA` node id, `age` property (details omitted), `42` value and command id `cmd-x`.
9. Repository resolves concurrent updates t `nodeA`, `age` property with "last write wins" strategy.
Repository updates internal representation with value `42`.
10. Repository creates event for update.
11. Repository emits event <<evnt-PropertyAdded>> with `nodeA` node id, `age` property (details omitted), `23` value and sequence number `1`.
It includes one <<commandSourceType>> with values `(client-a, cmd-1)` and `(other-client, cmd-x)`.
12. Client found a matching registered processed command id.
13. Client unregisters processed command id `cmd-1`.
14. Not all command sources could be matched against registered processed command ids.
Client forwards information to editor.
15. Client updates with new property value.

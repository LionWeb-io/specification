----
1. User enters new property value.
2. Client updates `nodeA` with new property value.
3. Client editor forwards user action into command.
4. Client sends `addProperty` command with `nodeA` node id, `age` property (details omitted), `23` value and command id `cmd-1`.
5. Repository registers command for processing.
6. Repository acknowledges reception of command with id `cmd-1`.
7. Client registers processed command id `cmd-1`.
8. Another client sends `addProperty` command `nodeA` node id, `age` property (details omitted), `42` value and command id `cmd-x`.
9. Repository resolves concurrent updates t `nodeA`, `age` property with "last write wins" strategy.
Repository updates internal representation with value `42`.
10. Repository creates event for update.
11. Repository emits event `propertyAdded` with `nodeA` node id, `age` property (details omitted) and `23` value.
It includes one <<commandSourceType>> with values `base64url(sha256("client-acmd-1"))` and `base64url(sha256("client-acmd-x"))`.
12. Client calculates `base64url(sha256(concat(__clientId__, __commandId__)))` for each registered processed command id.
13. Client found a matching registered processed command id.
Client unregisters processed command id `cmd-1`.
14. Not all command sources could be matched against registered processed command ids.
Client forwards information to editor.
15. Client updates with new property value.

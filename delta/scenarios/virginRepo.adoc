1. Client connects to repository with its client id `client-a`.
2. Repository confirms connection.
3. Client initiates new partition.
4. Client sends `addPartition` command with `nodeA` payload (details omitted) and command id `cmd-1`.
5. Repository registers command for processing.
6. Repository acknowledges reception of command with id `cmd-1`.
7. Repository updates internal representation.
8. Repository creates event for update.
9. Repository emits event `partitionAdded` with `nodeA` payload.
It includes one <<commandSourceType>> with value `base64url(sha256("client-acmd-1"))`
10. Client receives event and forwards information to editor.

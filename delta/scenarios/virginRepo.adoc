1. Client <<qry-signOn, signs on>> to repository.
2. Repository confirms participation with participation id `client-a`.
3. Client initiates new partition.
4. Client sends <<cmd-addPartition>> command with `nodeA` payload (details omitted) and command id `cmd-1`.
5. Repository registers command for processing.
6. Repository acknowledges reception of command with id `cmd-1`.
7. Repository updates internal representation.
8. Repository creates event for update.
9. Repository emits event <<evnt-partitionAdded>> with `nodeA` payload and sequence number `1`.
It includes one <<commandSourceType>> with value `(client-a, cmd-1)`
10. Client receives event and forwards information to editor.

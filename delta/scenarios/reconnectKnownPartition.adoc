----
1. Client knows the relevant partition, wants to subscribe.
2. Client sends `subscribePartition` query with partition node id `partition-id`.
3. Repository retrieves all contents of partition with node id `partition-id`.
4. Repository found contents.
5. Repository responds to query with id `qry-1` with contents of 3 nodes: `partitionNode`, `childNodeA`, `childNodeB` (details omitted).
6. Client receives query result and forwards information to editor.
7. Client draws `childNodeA` and `childNodeB`.
`partitionNode` is not drawn, it represents the canvas.

----
1. User enters new property value on node `nodeA` that's known to the editor.
2. Client editor forwards user action into command.
3. Client sends <<cmd-AddProperty>> command with `nodeA` node id, `age` property (details omitted), `23` value and command id `cmd-1`.
4. Repository registers command for processing.
5. Client registers processed command id `cmd-1`.
6. Client informs editor of command submission.
7. Repository tries to update internal representation.
Some error occurs (e.g. database unavailable).
8. Repository handles the error.
9. Repository creates event for notification.
10. Repository emits <<evnt-ErrorEvent>> with `internalError` error code, `internal error occurred` message and sequence number `1`.
It includes one <<commandSourceType>> with value `(participation-a, cmd-1)`.
11. Client removes `cmd-1` from open commands list.

----
1. User enters new property value.
2. Client editor forwards user action into command.
3. Client sends `addProperty` command with `nodeA` node id, `age` property (details omitted), `23` value and command id `cmd-1`.
4. Repository registers command for processing.
5. Repository acknowledges reception of command with id `cmd-1`.
6. Client informs editor of command submission.
7. Another client sends `addProperty` command `nodeA` node id, `age` property (details omitted), `42` value and command id `cmd-x`.
8. Repository resolves concurrent updates t `nodeA`, `age` property with "last write wins" strategy.
Repository updates internal representation with value `42`.
9. Repository creates event for update.
10. Repository emits event `propertyAdded` with `nodeA` node id, `age` property (details omitted) and `23` value.
It includes one <<commandSourceType>> with values `base64url(sha256("client-acmd-1"))` and `base64url(sha256("client-acmd-x"))`.
11. Client receives event and forwards information to editor.
12. Client updates `nodeA` with new property value.

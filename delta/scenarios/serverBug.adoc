----
1. User enters new property value on node `nodeA` that's known to the editor.
2. Client editor forwards user action into command.
3. Client sends <<cmd-AddProperty>> command with `nodeA` node id, `age` property (details omitted), `23` value and command id `cmd-1`.
4. Server registers command for processing.
5. Client registers processed command id `cmd-1`.
6. Client informs editor of command submission.
7. Server tries to update internal representation.
Some error occurs (e.g. database unavailable).
8. Server handles the error.
9. Server creates event for notification.
10. Server emits <<evnt-Error>> event with `internalError` error code, `internal error occurred` message and sequence number `1`.
It includes one <<commandSourceType>> with value `(participation-a, cmd-1)`.
11. Client removes `cmd-1` from open commands list.

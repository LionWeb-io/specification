1. User enters new property value on node `nodeA` that's known to the editor.
2. Client editor forwards user action into command.
3. Client sends `addProperty` command with `nodeA` node id, `age` property (details omitted), `23` value and command id `cmd-1`.
4. Repository registers command for processing.
5. Repository acknowledges reception of command with id `cmd-1`.
6. Client registers processed command id `cmd-1`.
7. Client informs editor of command submission.
8. Repository realizes it does not know a node with id `nodeA`
9. #TODO# How does client know its `addProperty` failed?

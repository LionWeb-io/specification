1. User enters new property value on node `nodeA` that's known to the editor.
2. Client editor forwards user action into command.
3. Client sends <<cmd-AddProperty>> command with `nodeA` node id, `age` property (details omitted), `23` value and command id `cmd-1`.
4. Server registers command for processing.
5. Client registers processed command id `cmd-1`.
6. Client informs editor of command submission.
7. Server realizes it does not know a node with id `nodeA`.
8. Server creates event for notification.
9. Server emits <<evnt-Error>> event with `unknownNode` error code, `cannot add property to unknown node` message and sequence number `1`.
It includes one <<commandSourceType>> with value `(participation-a, cmd-1)`.
10. Client removes `cmd-1` from open commands list.

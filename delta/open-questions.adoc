#TODO#

* Which of the events can potentially create invalid (recursively contained) trees?

* Which kind of errors do we accept?
How does this interact with concurrent edits?
Example: Does <<cmd-deleteChild>> fail if the `removedChild` does not exist?

* Do we need "swapNodes" event?

* Wording for commands/events: Shall we use "deleteXxx" everywhere? Or "removeXxx"? Or "deleteXxx" for deleting nodes, and "removeXxx" for removing properties / references?

* Decide on errors marked with #?# (invalid optional parameter values){fn-org312}

* How to report a command has completely been discarded, without any resulting event?{fn-org314}
